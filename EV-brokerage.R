# Function to calculate Everett and Valente (2016) brokerage scores for both undirected and directed graphs
# To report issues please contact: Babak Mahdavi Ardestani (bmahdaviardestani@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu)
# Inputs/Parameters: 
#   g: a graph (of type igraph or tidygraph)
#   as.graph (optional): by default the result is returned as data frame; to have result as a graph, set as.graph to TRUE
#   all.values (optional): by default is FALSE; if TRUE it will include all the other calculated values in addition to EV brokerage scores
#   as.graph (optional): by default, the result are returned as df; if TRUE, the output will be returned as a graph 
# Output/Returns: 
#   the score as df (by default) or as a graph if as.graph is set to TRUE
#   if the original grpah has original IDs (names), results will include the original IDs (names)
# Examples:
#    g <- readRDS("granovetter_graph.RDS") #figure 1 in Everett & Valente (2016) article, udirected graph
#    g <- readRDS("campnet_graph.RDS")     #figure 2 in Everett & Valente (2016) article,  direxted graph
#    res.df <- ev_brokerage(g)
#    res.g  <- ev_brokerage(g, as.graph=TRUE)
#    res.df  <- ev_brokerage(g, all.values=TRUE) #includes other calculated values in addition to EV brokerage scores
